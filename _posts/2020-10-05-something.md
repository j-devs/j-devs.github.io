### Becoming a Better Human
It’s incumbent on every person to be the best human being possible. We are inextricably tied to each other. With few exceptions, we are dependent on each other both individually and as a group for everything, from basic survival to income and economy.

There’s nothing I can do as one individual to turn the ship away from course in any meaningful way. However, I can change the world locally. I can make mountains move for individuals. I just need to figure out how I’m going to go about it. I like the idea of working in public health and I like the idea of being an FNP in underrepresented communities.

Once I’ve solved some real issues and have a firm grasp on what works, I can shift focus a bit to making the world better for more people by expanding my reach through essays and articles.

I want to solve big scary problems and I want to make people’s lives better.

### Who am I and who do I want to be?
I want to ride this line between professionalism and play. I need to stop describing it as a difficult balance. It’s not. It’s incredibly easy to be me. I just need to make sure I am covering my bases at all times. The rest of my time I can be a skater, surfer, cyclist, programmer, musician, healthcare provider, author. Why not? I can be anything and everything. There is only one life… live it.

How do I build this life I want?
First, I need to realize I already live my life. I just came back from Half Moon Bay last night. I could’ve easily made that trip solo and gone surfing and skating the whole time and slept in the bus. I would literally only need a board and some skate shoes and a surf board.
